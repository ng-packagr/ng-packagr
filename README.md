## Usage Example

For an Angular library, create one configuration file `ng-package.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/ng-packagr/ng-package.schema.json",
  "lib": {
    "entryFile": "public_api.ts"
  }
}
```

Then, build the library from a npm/yarn script defined in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "ng-packagr -p ng-package.json"
  }
}
```

Now build with this command:

```bash
$ yarn build
```

Paths are resolved relative to the location of the `ng-package.json` file.
The `package.json` describing the library should be located in the same folder, next to `ng-package.json`.

## Advanced Use Cases

#### Examples and Tutorials

Nikolas LeBlanc's story on medium.com: [Building an Angular 4 Component Library with the Angular CLI and ng-packagr](https://medium.com/@ngl817/building-an-angular-4-component-library-with-the-angular-cli-and-ng-packagr-53b2ade0701e)

Here is a [demo repository showing ng-packagr and Angular CLI](https://github.com/dherges/ng-packaged) in action.

What about [ng-packagr alongside Nx Workspace](https://github.com/dherges/nx-packaged)? Well, they work well together!


#### Configuration Locations

Configuration is picked up from the cli `-p` parameter, then from the default location for  `ng-package.json`, then from `package.json`.

To configure with `package.json`, put your ng-package configuration in the `ngPackage` field:

```json
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/ng-packagr/package.schema.json",
  "ngPackage": {
    "lib": {
      "entryFile": "public_api.ts"
    }
  }
}
```

Note: the JSON `$schema` reference enables JSON editing support (autocompletion) for the custom `ngPackage` property in an IDE like [VSCode](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode).

#### Secondary Entry Points

Beside the primary entry point, a package can contain one or more secondary entry points (e.g. `@angular/core/testing`, `@angular/cdk/a11y`, …).
These contain symbols that we don't want to group together with the symbols in the main entry.
The module id of a secondary entry directs the module loader to a sub-directory by the secondary's name.
For instance, `@angular/core/testing` resolves to a directory under `node_modules/@angular/core/testing` containing a `package.json` file that directs the loader to the correct location for what it's looking for.

For library developers, secondary entry points are dynamically discovered by searching for `package.json` files within sub directories of the main `package.json` file's folder!

##### So how do I use secondary entry points (sub-packages)?

All you have to do is create a `package.json` file and put it where you want a secondary entry point to be created.
One way this can be done is by mimicking the folder structure of the following example which has a testing entry point in addition to its main entry point.

```
my_package
├── src
|   └── *.ts
├── public_api.ts
├── ng-package.json
├── package.json
├── testing
    ├── src
    |   └── *.ts
    ├── public_api.ts
    └── package.json
```

The contents of the secondary `package.json` can be as simple as:
```json
{
  "ngPackage": {}
}
```

No, that is not a typo. No name is required. No version is required.
It's all handled for you by ng-packagr!
When built, the primary entry is imported with `@my/library` and the secondary entry with `@my/library/testing`.

##### What if I don't like `public_api.ts`?

You can change the entry point file by using the `ngPackage` configuration field in your secondary `package.json`.
For example, the following would use `index.ts` as the secondary entry point:

```json
{
  "ngPackage": {
    "lib": {
      "entryFile": "index.ts"
    }
  }
}
```

##### How do I use es2016 or es2017 features in my TypeScript library?

You can change the TypeScript language level support in tsconfig by also using the `ngPackage` configuration field in your secondary package.json` and setting the `languageLevel` property in `lib`:
For example,:

```json
{
  "ngPackage": {
    "lib": {
      "languageLevel": [ "dom", "es2017" ]
    }
  }
}
```

##### What if I want to use React Components?

If you have React Components that you're using in your library, and want to use proper JSX/TSX syntax in order to
construct them, you can set the `jsx` flag for your library through `ng-package` like so:

```json
{
  "$schema": "../../../src/ng-package.schema.json",
  "lib": {
    "entryFile": "public_api.ts",
    "externals": {
      "react": "React",
      "react-dom": "ReactDOM"
    },
    "jsx": "react"
  }
}
```

The `jsx` flag will accept anything that `tsconfig` accepts, more information [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html).

Note: Don't forget to include `react` and `react-dom` in your `externals` so that you're not bundling those dependencies.
