## Angular Package Format

Distribute sources? No good.
Build tools are complex: JavaScript module formats, TypeScript declaration files, AoT metadata,
A wall of tools: webpack, rollup, gulp, angular CLI, ember CLI, system.js


Design Doc / Spec:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZC2rcpxffTDfRDs6p1cfbmKNLA6x5O-NtkJglDaBVs/preview

Purpose of Angular Package Format: is compatible w/ most build tool chains.
E.g. `es5.js` for webpack / ng CLI.
`umd.js` for module loaders, e.g. SystemJS.
